Java Programming Masterclass

Section 1:

*Introduction to the course*

JDK - Java Development Kit
		-used to develop java projects
		
*Remaster in progress*

Section 3:

Hello world Project

Keywords are case sensitive
public - is an access modifier is the scope or how other parts of code access this code

class - define a class, the class name is followed by the keyword class

To define a class:
	- access modifier
	- keywod class
	- class name
	
20: Defining the Main Method
main method = entry point of program

Static is needed for java to find the method

datatype of the return value of the method

Statement = complete command to be executed and can include one or more expressions

21:

22: Variables

Variables are ways to store information in our computer

Different types of variables (Data Types)

int - numbers

To declare a variable use the datatype keyword i.e. int

= sign is used for assigning values

Java operators four common -> +,-,/,*

24. Primitive types
boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double

packages = a way to organize your java projects folders

Integer.MIN_VALUE = min value of datatype int

Integer = wrapper class; each primative type has a corresponding wrapper class

data overflow = if you go out of range of the data type it will attempt to create the value
	but it will circle around
data underflow is the opposite direction of the overflow

int will allow underscores as commas in large numbers eg. 2_147_483_647 for 2,147,483,647


25: byte, short, long and width
size of primitive types and width
byte = 8 bits, so it has a width of 8
short = 16 bits, width 16
int = 32 bits, width 32

each primitive type occupies a different amount of memory

long literal ends with 'L'
	if you don't have the 'L' it will treat it as an integer instead of a long
	-long do not have decimals
	
26. Casting in java
convert a number from one type to another
(datatype)(value to cast)

java automatically assumes a variable is an int. so always use int unless you got a really good reason to.

28: float and double primitive type

single has width of 32
double has width of 64

float use f e.g. 5f
double use d e.g. 5d

29: Floating point prec
float will go 7 digits after decimal
double will go 17 digits after decimal

30.The Char and Boolean Primitive Data Types
Char uses single quotes
string uses double quotes

char is 2 bytes = 16 width 
	- allows storing unicode characters
	
	-to use unicode must use \u then the unicode value
	\u tells java that the following numbers is a unicode value
	
Boolean true or false, 1 or 0
	-is____

31: Primitive Types recap and the string data type

string is a sequence of characters
limited by the heap space or the max_value of an int ~2.14 billion

doing '+' with string will cause it do concatonation, no other operators can be applied to string
strings are immuatable
	- a new string is created automatically, and discards the old one from memory
	
string appending is inefficient -> should use a string buffer

32: operators, operands and expressions
operators are special symbols that perform speicific tasks

operand is what's manuipulated by the operator
expression is a combination of operands and operators

x= where x is a operator is a short hand version of writing the operator
e.g. result *= 10 => result = result * 10

34. if-then statement
compare equals is 2 equal signs (==)

38.Ternary Operator
can only be used as part of an assignment cannot be used alone
e.g. boolean test = (x = 10) ? true : false;

43.Keywords and Expressions
Keywords are highlighted in blue in java
-reserved words 

expressions:
variable assignment
e.g. myVariable = 50
int myVariable = 50; <= is a statement 
control flow statement
	- things in the brackets are expressions
	

47.Methods in java
methods ~ function

55. Coding Exercises Example Part 2
to use methods from other classes state the class than use the dot notation to access the method
e.g. class.method()

56. Coding Excerises Example Part 3
methods that have print statements can be invoked from other methods/classes that being said if a method has a return type, it's necessary to do additional work with the result
i.e. cannot expect the return value to be printed if the type is not
